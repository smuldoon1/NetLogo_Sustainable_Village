# NetLogo_Sustainable_Village
Submission for an Artificial Intelligence module.
Developed as part of a team of three.

Villagers in the simulation hunt animals and eat berries to survive. They also have to build houses to accomodate for an increasing population.
If a villager has enough energy they will reproduce asexually and pass their behaviour values on to their children.
Over time their behaviour will evolve as a new villagers values are adjusted randomly slightly after being born.
The intention for this is to encourage the behaviour of the villagers who can survive and reproduce.
